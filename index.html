        <h2>Farm Info</h2>
        <p>Mario Santiz Lopez is a second-generation coffee farmer and the owner of Finca Vista Hermosa, a small 2.5-hectare farm in the Altos region of Chiapas. Before they grew coffee, Mario's parents raised corn and beans, but those crops did not provide enough income to sustain the family. Out of desperation, his father took a job at one of the larger area farms. It was there that he learned about coffee production and the potential earnings he could achieve by growing coffee.</p>
        <p>The Lopez family started growing coffee and things went well until 2012 when their coffee farm was hit by leaf rust. The disease decimated their farm. Production fell from 60 to just ten bags of coffee per year. Fortunately, in 2014 the Lopez family found support through the "Mas Cafe" project. The program helped the Lopez's renovate and recover two hectares. Soon, production increased to 720 bags per year, saving the Lopez family's farm and livelihood.</p>
        <p>The farming community in Altos is strong. Every year in August, area producers in this region celebrate the 'Virgen de Juquila' religious festivity. They have a big gathering where they invite friends and family to drink Posh (a local beverage) and eat Tamales. Each year after harvest, there is a similar celebration with the workers at the farm.</p>
        <p><strong>Be decent.</strong></p>
